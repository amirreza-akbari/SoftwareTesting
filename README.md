# Software Testing - Software Quiz Application

## Project Description ðŸ“–

This application is a software-related quiz that collects the user's first name, surname, and email. Once the information is provided, the user proceeds to the next page, where they answer ten specialized questions related to software. Each question is worth 2 points, and the quiz has a time limit. The scores are calculated and stored in a MySQL database. The results are displayed on the third page.
